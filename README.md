EchoMonitor is a stand-alone application for monitoring and controlling Echo360 capture appliances.

EchoMonitor informs the users of upcoming and ongoing lectures (including alerting the users about any problems during the lecture). EchoMonitor can be used as a 24/7 monitoring solution that does not need any user intervention to do its work.

## Why? ##
Confidence monitoring capabilities in Echo360 capture appliances need special attention and work from the lecturers. Detailed information about the current capture and confidence monitoring images are separated and thus it is hard to have an overview of what exactly is going on.

EchoMonitor has been built to be used as a separate **easy-to-use one-screen application** that gives lecturers all the information about next/current capture. EchoMonitor also has **built in visual alerts** to let the lecturer know of any possible errors with video, display or audio inputs.

## Who can use EchoMonitor? ##
**Lecturers and professors**:
  * EchoMonitor provides a simple and reliable confidence monitoring solution to lecturers and professors. The application can be installed on an old laptop computer (by the administrator) and will run 24/7. Lecturers and professors can step into the lecture hall and just by looking at the computers screen see when will the next capture start. During the capture EchoMonitor alerts the lecturers when there is a problem with one of the inputs.

**IT administrators**:
  * The IT administrator(s) can monitor all the capture appliances in their institution from one simple application (one at a time).
